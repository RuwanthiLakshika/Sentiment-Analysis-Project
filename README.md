## Problem Statement
In this project, aim to perform sentiment analysis on product reviews. Given a review, goal is to determine whether it is a positive or negative sentiment. We’ll also keep track of the count of positive and negative reviews separately.

### Approach
1. Data Collection:     
Gather a dataset of product reviews. This dataset should include both positive and negative reviews.  

2. Data Preprocessing:       
Clean the text data by removing special characters, stopwords, and performing stemming or lemmatization.
Convert the text into numerical features (e.g., using TF-IDF or word embeddings).  

3. Model Selection:      
Choose an appropriate machine learning model for sentiment analysis.

4. Model Training:       
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the selected model on the training data.    

5. Model Evaluation:       
Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Fine-tune hyperparameters if necessary.

7. Predictions:        
Apply the trained model to predict sentiments for new reviews.   

8. Counting Positive and Negative Reviews:     
Keep track of the number of positive and neative reviews separately.
